file = open("message.txt", w, encoding="utf-8")
file.write("hello, world\n")
file.write("end")
file.close()

file = open("message.txt", encoding = "utf-8")
file_contents = file.read()

with open("message.txt", encoding="utf-8") as file_obj:#"with" closes automatically. it's standard practice.
    content=file_obj.read()


file.mode #pretty cool
file.read(99) #reads next 99 bytes. also cool
file.readline() #reads next line. you might actually use this one, since it'd help with extracting data from huge
#...databases with a great many columns. which also happens to be a use case for python for data analysis
#because excel is limited to like 16k columns. because it sucks.
#excel is for casuals
#don't be a casual
#if you're reading this hire me
