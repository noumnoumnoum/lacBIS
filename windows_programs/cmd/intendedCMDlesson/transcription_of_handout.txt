STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO WINDOWS COMMAND LINE

INTRODUCTION TO THE WINDOWS COMMAND LINE
The Windows Command Line (Command Prompt) is a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system. To open quickly hit the windows key and type "cmd" [or use win+r -> cmd -> enter]
Path = (source or destination) example "c:\users\Admin\Desktop"

BASIC NAVIGATION COMMANDS
Use the following commands to navigate through directories:
dir - List the coontents of a directory
cd - change directory. (cd c:\Users\Admin\Desktop)
cd.. - Move to the parent directory
cls - Clear the command line screen

FILE AND DIRECTORY OPERATIONS
To manage file sand directories:

mkdir "path\folder_name" - Create a new directory. (use _ for naming or it'll create multiple folder/directories)
Example: mkdir c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\folder_name
rmdir "path\folder_name" - Remove a directory.

copy <source> <destination> - Copy a file. if you're in the directory of the file you can just use the file name and destination path, "copy testfile.txt c:\Users\Admin\Desktop")

move <source> <destination> - Move a file

del "path\file_name.txt" - permanently delete a file

NETWORKING COMMANDS
Troubleshoot and manage networks using:

ipconfig - View network configuration.
ping <address> - Test network connectivity. (can ping ip address or url - "ping google.com")
tracert <address> - trace the route packets take.
netstat - display network statistics

PROCESS MANAGEMENT
To manage processes:

tasklist - view running processes
taskkill /im <name> /f - kill a process by name [/im <name> seems to replace "IMAGENAME eq <name>". I don't remember what uses the second syntax, probably linux]
taskkill /pid <PID> /f - Kill a process by PID# [in linux it's just "kill <pid>". also, you usually want to use the /r or /t (I forget which) flags, to kill subprocesses as well]

POWERSHELL VS COMMAND LINE
PowerShell provides advanced feature scompared to Command Prompt, including scripting capabilities and integration with modern tools.
[I like to avoid using powershell as an exercise, but there are some solid options it gives that offer 1 line options that CMD would need 5+ lines for]

FINAL REVIEW AND RESOURCES
Key commands to remember: 'dir', 'cd', 'ipconfig', 'ping', 'tasklist'

SCRIPTING WITH BATCH FILES
Steps to create and run a batch script:
1. Open Notepad from Desktop
2. Copy the text below

 @echo off
 echo Welcome to batch scripting!
 echo
 mkdir C:\LabDirectory
 echo This is a test file. >C:\LabDirectory\testfile.txt
 copy C:\LabDirectory\testfile.txt C:\LabDirectory\copiedfile.txt
 echo Here are the files in C:\LabDirectory:
 dir C:\LabDirectory
 pause

3. Save the file as labscript.bat
4. Run the script using the command prompt: "labscript.bat"
 Check your work, change the directory to the lab directory and view its content. You should see bot htestfile.txt and copiedfile.txt
 
 cd c:\LabDirectory
 dir

HOW TO RESET
In order to reset we need to remove the files first. Keep in mind that you can't remove or delete a folder (directory) if it's populated with another file.
 1. Del c:\LabDirectory\Testfile.txt
 2. Del c:\LabDirectory\copiedfile.txt
 3. cd c:\
 4. rmdir LabDirectory
