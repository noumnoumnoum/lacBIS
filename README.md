This is the directory where I keep all the files I created during my business information systems course.
These files were not designed to be copied, although with some basic edits you should be able to set them up for your machine/network.
Note that craftsmanship is of the lowest quality, and the code was not designed to be readable.
In many cases the scripts were designed purely to remove boredom. Or to crash my computer.
There is also an image of a rabbit.
Enjoy.
