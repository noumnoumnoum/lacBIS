This is the directory where I keep all the files I created during my business information systems course.
/mainfolder contains the files created in Windows during the first three weeks of the course, prior to my migration to my linux machine.
These files were not designed to be copied, although with some basic edits you should be able to set them up for your machine/network
Note that craftsmanship is of the lowest quality, and the code was not designed to be readable.
In many cases the scripts were designed purely to remove boredom. Or to crash my computer.
There is also an image of a rabbit.
Enjoy.
